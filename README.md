# Cyber Security Portfolio

I am a cyber security graduate with hands-on experience across security operations, public key infrastructure, and network security. My work focuses on building, validating, and documenting real-world security controls rather than theoretical exercises.

## Core Focus Areas
- Security operations and incident analysis
- Vulnerability management and threat detection
- Public Key Infrastructure and cryptography
- Network security, firewalls, and VPNs

## Featured Projects
- PKI Secure File Exchange – end-to-end certificate lifecycle, encryption, signatures, and replay protection
- Vulnerability Management and Active Defense – Nessus scanning, honeypot deployment, and attack detection
- Network Traffic Attack Analysis – PCAP-based investigation of reconnaissance, brute-force, and exfiltration
- Secure Network Devices and VPN – FortiGate firewall configuration with IPsec tunnels and policy enforcement

## Tooling and Technologies
Nessus, Wireshark, FortiGate, OpenSSL, Kali Linux, Windows Server, Linux, Nmap, IPsec VPN, AES, RSA, SHA-256

## Career Direction
SOC Analyst, Security Operations, PKI and IAM, Network Security Engineering

## Cyber SCI Ottawa 2025 
I volunteered at CyberSCI Ottawa 2025, a leading Canadian cybersecurity conference bringing together practitioners, researchers, vendors, and public sector leaders. The role involved supporting conference operations, assisting speakers and attendees, and ensuring smooth execution of technical sessions, panels, and networking events.  Through this experience, I gained direct exposure to real-world cybersecurity discussions across incident response, threat intelligence, cloud security, and critical infrastructure protection. I interacted with security professionals from government, utilities, financial services, and private industry, strengthening my understanding of how theory translates into operational security practice.  Volunteering at CyberSCI 2025 reinforced my interest in security operations and incident response, expanded my professional network, and provided insight into current threat trends, tooling, and workforce expectations in the Canadian cybersecurity landscape.
